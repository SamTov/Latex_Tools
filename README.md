# Latex Tools
These are just tools I use frequently when develop documents with Latex. The 
repository is broken down into directories for each stage of the document 
development process. Contents of each is briefly described below.

## Compile
In this directory you will find all tools related to compiling the latex
code.

* Makefile: This is a makefile that can be used to compile Latex code and
	    manage the directory structure for linux and macos systems.
